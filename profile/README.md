The Patristic Text Archive (PTA) is the home of digital critical editions made at the project [“Die alexandrinische und antiochenische Bibelexegese in der Spätantike”](https://bibelexegese.bbaw.de) at [Berlin Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (BBAW)](https://www.bbaw.de). The project is part of the [Academies Programme](http://www.akademienunion.de/forschung/akademienprogramm/), a research funding programme co-financed by the German federal government and individual federal states. Coordinated by the [Union of the German Academies of Sciences and Humanities](http://www.akademienunion.de/akademienunion/ueber-uns/), the programme intends to retrieve and explore our cultural heritage, to make it accessible and highlight its relevance to the present, as well as to preserve it for future.

The repositories here contain the [data of the editions](https://github.com/PatristicTextArchive/pta_data) and the [manuscript database](https://github.com/PatristicTextArchive/pta_manuscripts), the [TEI-Schema](https://github.com/PatristicTextArchive/Schema), the [metadata](https://github.com/PatristicTextArchive/pta_metadata) generated for the [web publication platform](https://pta.bbaw.de) and its [documentation](https://github.com/PatristicTextArchive/pta_frontend_documentation) as well as the code of the [PTA-WebApp](https://github.com/PatristicTextArchive/pta_webapp) and some other tools and data partially forked from other projects.
